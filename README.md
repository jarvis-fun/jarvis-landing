# Jarvis Landing

This repository hosts the **public-facing landing page** for [Jarvis](https://jarvis.fun)—showcasing the platform’s AI-driven crypto trading features, benefits, and quick-start instructions. Built with **React** and **Vite**, this landing page is designed for speed, simplicity, and easy deployment.

## Project Overview

- **Framework**: [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- **Build Tool**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Purpose**: Provide a high-level introduction to Jarvis, including highlights, key differentiators, and links to get started.
